                    <h4>A lovely Princess Birthday <i class="fa-solid fa-crown"></i></h4>
                    <p>One of my friends had a big birthday - she was turning 30! Maybe for some this is the real end of
                        childhood and the beginning of fully-fledged adulthood. I agree to disagree.
                        I conspired with her other friends and we planned a lovely girly cake, with lots of empowering
                        words
                        from adulthood written on it in bitter dark chocolate. And this is how the alternative princess
                        cake
                        was
                        born. <br />
                        A genoise sponge, split in two layers. On the first layer there is some lovely raspberry jam,
                        topped
                        with a layer of homemade citrussy custard, then there is a second layer of genoise and a second
                        layer of
                        custard. The dome shape is artfully given by shaped chilled hand-whipped cream, on top of which
                        a
                        layer
                        of homemade marzipan has been carefully laid down. After, decorations have been added in dark
                        chocolate
                        and a handmade sugar rose tops the whole cake. </p>

                    <h4>A light and elegant engagement <i class="fa-solid fa-ring"></i></h4>
                    <p>I got a wonderful yet awful bit of news recently: two of my youngest friends are engaged to be
                        married!
                        Lovely because they are celebrating their commitment to one another in front of their dearest
                        friends
                        and family members, awful because - well - they are at least 5 years younger than me and now I
                        feel
                        old.
                        Regardless, I had to give them the best engagement present I possibly could - it was CAKE TIME.
                        <br />
                        This engagement cake is as sweet as it is stable (with a bit of hidden fun). It has two layers
                        of
                        sponge
                        (both soaked in citrussy rhum), between which sits a layer of homemade strawberry jam and
                        hand-whipped
                        premium quality cream mixed in with hand-diced fresh strawberries. Outside it is lavisciously
                        covered in
                        vanilla whipped-cream and topped with fresh strawberries, bluberries and mint leaves. The cherry
                        on
                        top
                        being the two sugar-paste engagement rings, filled with edible gold glitter.
